# Design
### Colours
- The main colour used on the header and footer is grey/#6096969/ to match the colour of the logo. I have also used the same colour for the font throughout the site. The additional colours are plain white. I have only used these two colours to create simplicity and make the photos stand out.
### Typography
- I have used Montserrat and Chango with Sans Serif as a fallback to reflect the font on the logo. The weight of the font has been reduced or increased based on the other elements each page.
### Images
- The images are provided from the owner. I have used other images used as a background. On the homepage the background colour is matching the interior of the place and is giving additional style to the page. All additional images used are taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
### Media
- The video of the steaming cup of coffee has been downloaded from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
