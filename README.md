### Strategy 
- The main strategy of the site is to turn visitors into customers. Once the user has explored the site they would be interested to visit the place and return.
### First time visitor goals
 - I would like to find out more about the location, drinks menu and the facilities of the place.
- I would like to be able to navigate easily around the site and don't get lost in the content

### Returning visitor goals
- I want to be able to leave feedback about my experience
- I would like to know more about new drinks and services offered, to make sure I am not missing out
- I would like to be able to contact the place through social media
